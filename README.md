This repo contains the system verilog code and test bench waveform for an 8-bit Harvard Architecture cpu that I implmented on a Nexys-A7 FPGA using Xilinx Vivado. The repo also contains the state machine, opcodes, and block diagram for the cpu
The system has an instruction memory which i've loaded with custom Assembly code. The assembly code and its output was manually calculated on a spread sheet. These spreadsheets can be found in the AssemblyCodes folder
